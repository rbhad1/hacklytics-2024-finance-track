# Financial Web Application

A financial web application using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook for a data science Hackathon. The purpose of this project was the increase proficiency with working APIs and front-end development. This project also provided the opportunity to learn Flask and work with PyCharm for the first time. 

In this project, my teammate and I:
- Parsed Yahoo Finance API using Python to collect financial data to display percent changes of key earning metrics from year to year for casual investors
- Developed a brute-force algorithm in Python to analyze financial data and generate a composite score by averaging key metrics, capturing earnings changes from FY2022 to FY2023


If I had had more time, we would have improved the front-end display by loading the data in a table and built a more rigorous scoring algorithm. 

To run the project: 
1) Clone the repo
2) Open the folder in VSC
3) Run the app.py
4) Open the host link in a browser

To use the application, input a valid ticker and press enter. On the screen will display a few key earnings metrics and a score.
